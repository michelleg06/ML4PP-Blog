Or, you might run into trouble when trying to replicate the task locally. For those, or any other thoughts you may want to share, we’ll open a blog post to which you can react by leaving a message. The course coordinators or your peers can reply to you. If you’d like to receive responses privately, leave your email in the comment!\n\n\n\n",
