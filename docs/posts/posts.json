If you found difficulties, feel free to leave a message here.\nScript elegance\nThe two introductory scripts, for R and Python, are meant to give you a quick glimpse of the language. They’re by no means elegant. Perhaps a few standard points that were not discussed in the tutorial but that you can take away if you decide to write a script:\nWhen you assign a name to an object, make sure that it is informative. When you start a new project, you might even write down a naming convention. For instance:\nAll variables that measure some form of spending will begin with spend_*\nIf the measurement is related to the individual, it should end by the subscript _i*\n\nTry to contain all instructions related to packages, libraries, and function imports at the beginning of your script, in one chunk. I have broken this rule in the python script (oops!). Do as I say, not as I do. If you realise that you need to load a new library as you go alog (this is perfectly normal!) go back to the section of your script where all that is kept and load it there. It makes for a cleaner look and for easier reproduction of your code.\nFor R, make sure to keep a header containing the R and Rstudio versions you’re using. This is important for transparency and reproducibility of your your code.\nFor Python, make sure you create a virtual environment before starting a script. This is important for reproducibility of your code, as it contains all the installations needed to execute your script.\nIn Python, if you’re collaborating with other people, you might want to include a ‘requirements.txt’ file in your project folder to let others know what installations they might need before attempting to run your script. You can create such a file with a simple command.\nThe list above is not exhaustive, and I am far from an expert on this particular topic. Nonetheless, I hope it is helpful, and that you’ll learn more and better ways to keep your script up to standard!\nA final thought\nFor R, the Rstudio IDE is excellent and free (open source!). However, Python doesn’t have a default user interface. PyCharm is a popular IDE, but it is not free. Personally, I enjoy using Visual Studio Code (and I recommend it), because it is free (hooray!) and it has lots of plugins that are quite helpful. Jupyter Notebook (stands for Julia-Python-R) is also free, user-friendly, and quite popular. For those of you not averse to working with Google products, you can also use the Collaboratory to write scripts. Ultimately, this is a personal preference. Choose wisely and happy coding!\n\n\n\n",

Furthermore, an use-case on Social Protection Policy was introduced, and we embarked on a machine learning mission: what algorithm can help us predict the prevalence of poverty in Malawi best?\nPlease feel free to leave a comment here if you have any questions about what constitutes a prediction policy problem, how to identify a social need for prediction, or if you have any questions about the practical applications in R or Python. As always, you can also leave a comment to suggest a date to meet up in Gather.Town with other people so you can chat in real time!\nHappy coding, everyone!\n\n\n\n",
