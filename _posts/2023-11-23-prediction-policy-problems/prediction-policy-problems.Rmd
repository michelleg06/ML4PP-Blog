## Overview

In the [Prediction Policy Problems](https://www.ml4publicpolicy.com/predictionpolicy.html) tab of the ML4PP site there was a brief introduction to what a Prediction Policy Problem is. Furthermore, an use-case on Social Protection Policy was introduced, and we embarked on a machine learning mission: what algorithm can help us predict the prevalence of poverty in Malawi best? 

Please feel free to leave a comment here if you have any questions about what constitutes a prediction policy problem, how to identify a social need for prediction, or if you have any questions about the practical applications in R or Python. As always, you can also leave a comment to suggest a date to meet up in [Gather.Town](https://app.gather.town/app/oHbUVQSaCs7SOToI/ML%20for%20Public%20Policy) with other people so you can chat in real time!

Happy coding, everyone!
